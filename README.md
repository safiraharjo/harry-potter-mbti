# Harry Potter and the Diverging Personalities

The primary objective of this project is to identify the personality traits of the lead characters in the Harry Potter movie sequel using the MBTI assessments. 

The research questions that we are going to address are as follows:  
1. What are the MBTI personality types of each character?  
2. Are there any similarities among the characters' personalities depending on their roles (heroes vs. villains, Hogwarts houses)?  
3. How alike or compatible are the personalities of the two most famous couples in the novels (Harry and Ginny, Hermione and Ron)?
